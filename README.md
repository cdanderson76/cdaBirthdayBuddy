This is an in-course project (https://www.udemy.com/home/my-courses/learning/) that I completed.  This basically covered how to use external data and render it dynamically through iteration.  There is also a light bit of functionality to this project, as there is a 'Clear All' button at the bottom of the app.  If you press this button, it will clear the content on the page and show that there are no birthdays for 'today'.
